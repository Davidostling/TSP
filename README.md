# TSP

The objective of this group project was to devise a solution to the traveling salesman problem *(TSP)* that would find the shortest tour visiting all *n* cities exactly once within a time constraint of two seconds. The TSP is defined by a set of *n* cities, with the distance between each city *i* and city *j* given by the Euclidean distance between them and rounded to the nearest integer. Our solution relied on several technical approaches, including greedy nearest neighbor, two-opt, two-opt swap, and randomization. The goal was to find the best possible solution within the alloted time.

A comprehensive, more detailed explanation of the problem as well as our proposed solution can be found in the **TSP_Project.pdf** file.
